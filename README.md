# Bomberman
Final project of the lecture *Fundamentals of Machine Learning* at the University of Heidelberg. The goal is to create an agent playing the game Bomberman using reinforcement learning. The framework for this project can be found at [https://github.com/ukoethe/bomberman_rl](https://github.com/ukoethe/bomberman_rl).

To run a demo of our agent **maverick** download the repository and run ``python main.py play --agents maverick rule_based_agent rule_based_agent rule_based_agent``.

## Final version
Here are two examples of our final result:

### Good game: 
maverick has luck and finds a lot of coins in good positions. Towards the end of the game he stays out of fights.
